# JWT POC

This project is a proof of concept (POC) for JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It consists of an NPM package called [JWT library](jwt-library), which provides functionality for generating and validating JWT tokens. Additionally, there is a [Next.js app](jwt-api) that serves as an example of how to use the JWT library's API to generate and validate tokens.


## How JWT Works?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. It consists of three parts: the header, the payload, and the signature.

When a JWT token is generated, the header contains information about the algorithm used for signing the token, such as HMAC, RSA, or ECDSA. The payload contains the claims or statements about the user or entity, such as the user ID or role. These claims are encoded as a JSON object.

To generate a JWT token, the server combines the header and payload, signs them using a secret key, and produces a signature. The signature ensures the integrity of the token and prevents tampering.

Once the JWT token is generated, it can be transmitted between parties using various methods, such as including it in the Authorization header of an HTTP request or embedding it in the URL as a query parameter.

At the API server, the JWT token is received and verified. The server extracts the header and payload from the token and recalculates the signature using the same secret key. If the recalculated signature matches the signature in the token, it means the token is valid and has not been tampered with.

The server can then access the claims in the payload to authenticate and authorize the user or entity. This allows the server to make informed decisions about granting or denying access to protected resources.

In summary, JWT tokens are generated by combining a header and payload, signing them with a secret key, and producing a signature. The token can be transmitted between parties and verified at the API server by recalculating the signature and checking its integrity. The payload contains claims that can be used for authentication and authorization purposes.
